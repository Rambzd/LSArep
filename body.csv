"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,","The Raven"
"Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—","The Raven"
"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,","The Raven"
"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.","The Raven"
"“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—","The Raven"
"Only this and nothing more.”","The Raven"
"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;","The Raven"
"And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.","The Raven"
"Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow","The Raven"
"From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—","The Raven"
"For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—","The Raven"
"Nameless here for evermore.","The Raven"
"And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain","The Raven"
"Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;","The Raven"
"So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating","The Raven"
"“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—","The Raven"
"Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—","The Raven"
"This it is and nothing more.”","The Raven"
"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,","The Raven"
"“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;","The Raven"
"But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,","The Raven"
"And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,","The Raven"
"That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—","The Raven"
"Darkness there and nothing more.","The Raven"
"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,","The Raven"
"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;","The Raven"
"But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,","The Raven"
"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”","The Raven"
"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—","The Raven"
"Merely this and nothing more.","The Raven"
"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,","The Raven"
"Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.","The Raven"
"“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;","The Raven"
"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—","The Raven"
"Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—","The Raven"
"’Tis the wind and nothing more!”","The Raven"
"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,","The Raven"
"In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;","The Raven"
"Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;","The Raven"
"But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—","The Raven"
"Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—","The Raven"
"Perched, and sat, and nothing more.","The Raven"
"Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,","The Raven"
"By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,","The Raven"
"“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,","The Raven"
"Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—","The Raven"
"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”","The Raven"
"Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,","The Raven"
"Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;","The Raven"
"For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being","The Raven"
"Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—","The Raven"
"Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,","The Raven"
"With such name as “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only","The Raven"
"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.","The Raven"
"Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—","The Raven"
"Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—","The Raven"
"On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”","The Raven"
"Then the bird said “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,","The Raven"
"“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store","The Raven"
"Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster","The Raven"
"Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—","The Raven"
"Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore","The Raven"
"Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”","The Raven"
"But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,","The Raven"
"Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;","The Raven"
"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking","The Raven"
"Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—","The Raven"
"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore","The Raven"
"Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing","The Raven"
"To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;","The Raven"
"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining","The Raven"
"On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,","The Raven"
"But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,","The Raven"
"She shall press, ah, nevermore!","The Raven"
"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer","The Raven"
"Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.","The Raven"
"“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee","The Raven"
"Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;","The Raven"
"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”","The Raven"
"Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—","The Raven"
"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,","The Raven"
"Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—","The Raven"
"On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—","The Raven"
"Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”","The Raven"
"Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!","The Raven"
"By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—","The Raven"
"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,","The Raven"
"It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—","The Raven"
"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”","The Raven"
"Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—","The Raven"
"“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!","The Raven"
"Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!","The Raven"
"Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!","The Raven"
"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”","The Raven"
"Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”","The Raven"
"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting","The Raven"
"On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;","The Raven"
"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,","The Raven"
"And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;","The Raven"
"And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor","The Raven"
"Shall be lifted—nevermore!","The Raven"
